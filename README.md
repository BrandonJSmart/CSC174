I am going to be writing a markdown document about the different iphones. Iphone 7, 8, and 10. These phones were all roughly the same thing but with increasingly better screens and processors as the generations increased.

## Iphone 7  
The iPhone 7's overall design is similar to the iPhone 6S, but introduces new color options (matte black and jet black), water and dust resistance, a new capacitive, static home button, and removes the 3.5 mm  
### Tech Specs
- Average screen
- Average processor

## Iphone 8  
Besides the addition of a glass back, the designs of iPhone 8 and 8 Plus are largely similar to that of their predecessors. Notable changes include the addition of wireless charging, a faster processor, and improved cameras and displays. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus share most of their internal hardware with the iPhone X.
### Tech Specs
- Better screen
- Better processor

## Iphone 10  
The iPhone X is intended to showcase what Apple considers technology of the future, specifically adopting OLED screen technology for the first time in iPhone history, as well as using a glass and stainless-steel form factor, offering wireless charging, and removing the home button in favor of introducing a new bezel-less design, almost removing all the bezels in the smartphone and not having a "chin", unlike many Android phones. 
### Tech Specs
- Amazing screen
- Amazing processor
